              <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Our story unfolds with a shared passion for customising mechanical keyboards,
                  uniting a group of like-minded hobbyists. The inception of our shop was sparked
                  when our collective experiences, discomfort due to prolonged typing with
                  unsuitable keyboards, propelled us into the realm of seeking more ergonomic
                  solutions. Identifying a void in the local market for mechanical keyboard
                  customisation, we saw an opportunity to pool our expertise and establish a hub
                  for enthusiasts.</p>
                  <p>Fueled by a desire to make quality keyboards more accessible and to streamline
                  the cumbersome process of sourcing components from overseas, our collective
                  vision materialised into the founding of our mechanical keyboard shop.</p>
                  <p>Join us in celebrating the art of customisation and the pursuit of a more
                    comfortable and enjoyable typing experience.</p>
